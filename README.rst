   -  `Backend`_
   -  `Frontend`_
   -  `CLI and Libraries`_

-  `Documentation`_

-  `Backend Design`_

What is this?
-------------

This is a **cli and library** project to support encryption/decryption
of expendable notes

An example of a backend that uses the libraries provided here can be
found at https://cenot.es

What this isnâ€™t
---------------

UI/Frontend/Backend. This is a **cli/library** project. Frontend and
backend solutions are different projects. The reason for this is to
allow flexibility in frontend / backend choice and to avoid huge bundle
projects.

-  A **backend** project that uses these libraries can be found `here`_

-  A **frontend** project that communicates with the **backend** can be
   found `here <https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes-reaction>`__

Features
--------

-  Symmetric encryption of notes using the `pynacl`_ project

How does this work?
-------------------

See `design`_
