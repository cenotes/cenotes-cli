## What is this?

This is a **cli and library** project to support encryption/decryption of expendable
notes

An example of a backend that uses the libraries provided here can be found at 
<https://cenot.es>

## What this isn't

UI/Frontend/Backend. This is a **cli/library** project. Frontend and backend 
solutions are different projects. The reason for this is to allow flexibility in
frontend / backend choice and to avoid huge bundle projects.

- A **backend** project that uses these libraries can be
found [here](https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes)

- A **frontend** project that communicates with the **backend** can be
found [here](https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes-reaction)

## Features

  - Symmetric encryption of notes using the
    [pynacl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project
